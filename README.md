# Authentication
This is basically a authentication Code ,,which determines who can access the particular user is real or fake.
This is a simple Java-based authentication program that prompts the user to enter a username and password. It then verifies the credentials against predefined values and provides an authentication status.

Features

Compares input credentials with predefined valid credentials.
Displays authentication success or failure message.

Valid Credentials
The program currently supports two predefined users:
Username: user1, Password: abcd
Username: user2, Password: 120

Notes
The program uses Scanner to take input from the user.
The equals method is used for string comparison.
Currently, the program does not store or encrypt passwords securely; it is intended for basic demonstration purposes.
